implement your sorting algorithms. You must implement one algorithm in Category 1 and one algorithm in Category 2. 

Category 1:  insertion sort, selection sort, bubble sort,

Category 2: merge sort, quick sort

 

Required test cases:

            Array list:        [ 30, 10, 21, 15, 18, 42, 7, 28, 11, 17, 9, 2, 12, 14, 50]

Required output:

            The correct results for the input.

 

 

Subproject 2 (4 points):

Requirements:

Develop a non-recursive post-order traversal program (algorithm) for the binary tree as follows. You can create the module of building the binary tree by yourself.
