This is an assignment that was given to implement a qeue system.

THIS IS STILL A WORK IN PROGRESS

a. Write the definitions of the functions setWaitingTime, getArrivalTime, getTransactionTime, 
and getCustomerNumber of the class customerType defined in the section Application of Queues: Simulation. 

b. Write the definitions of the functions getRemainingTransactionTime, setCurrentCustomer, getCurrentCustomerNumber, 
getCurrentCustomerArrivalTime, getCurrentCustomerWaitingTime, and getCurrentCustomerTransactionTime of the class serverType defined 
in the section Application of Queues: Simulation. 

c. Write the definition of the function runSimulation to complete the design of the computer simulation program 
(see the section Application of Queues: Simulation). Test run your program for a variety of data. Moreover, 
use a random number generator to decide whether a customer arrived at a given time unit.
